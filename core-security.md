# Platform Security

This document outlines the key security measures implemented in the Widgetizer backend to protect the application, its data, and its users.

## 🛡️ Core Security Layers

These layers are applied automatically to API endpoints and provide a robust baseline of protection.

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization

- **What it is:** All incoming data from the client (e.g., in `req.body` or `req.params`) is rigorously validated and sanitized before being processed by the controllers.
- **Why it's important:** This is the primary defense against common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data integrity issues. It ensures that only well-formed data is accepted by the application.
- **Implementation:** Achieved using the `express-validator` library on all API routes that accept input.

### 2. API Rate Limiting

- **What it is:** Limits the number of requests an IP address can make to the API within a specific timeframe.
- **Why it's important:** Prevents abuse and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks where a single actor could overwhelm the server, making it unavailable for legitimate users.
- **Implementation:** Uses the `express-rate-limit` package. Two policies are in place:
  - **Editor routes** (`/api/projects`, `/api/themes`, `/api/pages`, `/api/preview`): 1500 requests per 15 minutes
  - **Other API routes** (`/api/menus`, `/api/media`, `/api/export`, `/api/settings`): 5000 requests per 15 minutes

### 3. HTTP Security Headers [PENDING]

- **What it is:** A collection of special HTTP headers are sent with every response from the server.
- **Why it's important:** These headers instruct the browser to enable its built-in security features, providing powerful protection against attacks like clickjacking, MIME-type sniffing, and cross-site scripting.
- **Implementation:** The `helmet` package can be used as a global middleware to set these headers on all responses. _This is not currently implemented._

### 4. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

- **What it is:** The server controls which domains are allowed to access the API.
- **Why it's important:** Prevents unauthorized websites from making requests to your API.
- **Implementation:** The `cors` package is enabled globally (`app.use(cors())`). In a production environment, this should be configured to whitelist specific domains.

### 5. Multi-layered SVG Sanitization

- **What it is:** All uploaded SVG files are sanitized twice: first on the client using `DOMPurify` before upload, and then again on the server using `isomorphic-dompurify`.
- **Why it's important:** SVGs are XML files that can contain JavaScript (XSS vectors). Defense-in-depth ensures that even if client-side sanitization is bypassed, the server protects the filesystem.
- **Implementation:** Integrated into `useMediaUpload.js` (client) and `mediaController.js` (server).

### 6. Global Error Handling

- **What it is:** A catch-all "safety net" middleware that handles any unexpected errors that occur within the application.
- **Why it's important:** Prevents the server from crashing due to unhandled exceptions. It also ensures that sensitive error details (like stack traces) are not leaked to the client in a production environment.
- **Implementation:** A custom error-handling middleware (`server/middleware/errorHandler.js`) is registered as the final middleware in `server/index.js`.

### 7. Advanced Theme Settings Security

- **What it is:** Advanced theme settings allow users to inject custom CSS and JavaScript directly into their theme templates through the `custom_css`, `custom_head_scripts`, and `custom_footer_scripts` settings.
- **Why it's important:** These settings provide powerful customization capabilities but introduce significant security risks if not properly understood and managed.
- **Implementation:** These settings are rendered through custom Liquid tags (`{% custom_css %}`, `{% custom_head_scripts %}`, `{% custom_footer_scripts %}`) that output raw HTML/CSS content without sanitization.

#### Security Risks

**1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities**
- The `custom_head_scripts` and `custom_footer_scripts` settings accept raw HTML/JavaScript that is rendered directly into the page without any sanitization or Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions.
- Malicious JavaScript injected through these settings can:
  - Steal user session cookies and authentication tokens
  - Perform unauthorized actions on behalf of users
  - Redirect users to malicious websites
  - Access and exfiltrate sensitive user data
  - Modify page content to display phishing content

**2. CSS Injection Attacks**
- The `custom_css` setting allows arbitrary CSS to be injected into the page.
- While CSS cannot directly execute JavaScript, it can be used for:
  - UI redressing attacks (making malicious elements appear legitimate)
  - Data exfiltration through CSS attribute selectors and `@import` directives
  - Privacy violations by detecting visited links
  - Clickjacking attacks by overlaying transparent elements

**3. Content Security Policy (CSP) Bypass**
- If a CSP is implemented, inline scripts and styles injected through these settings may bypass CSP restrictions, depending on the policy configuration.
- This can undermine other security measures put in place.

**4. Third-Party Script Risks**
- Users may paste third-party scripts (e.g., Google Analytics, advertising scripts) that:
  - Load additional scripts from external domains
  - Track user behavior across sites
  - May be compromised or replaced with malicious versions
  - Can introduce supply chain vulnerabilities

#### Mitigation Strategies

**For Theme Authors:**
1. **Documentation and Warnings**: Clearly document that these are advanced settings intended for trusted users only.
2. **Placement Control**: Theme authors control where these tags are placed in `layout.liquid`, allowing them to position them appropriately (e.g., after other critical assets).
3. **Optional Implementation**: Theme authors can choose not to include these tags in their themes if they don't want to expose this functionality.

**For End Users:**
1. **Trust and Verification**: Only paste code from trusted sources. Verify the integrity of third-party scripts before adding them.
2. **Minimal Code**: Only include the minimum necessary code. Avoid pasting entire HTML documents or unnecessary scripts.
3. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review and audit custom code to ensure it hasn't been modified or compromised.
4. **Testing**: Test custom code in a development environment before deploying to production.

**For Administrators:**
1. **Access Control**: Consider restricting access to theme settings based on user roles or permissions if implementing a multi-user system.
2. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for changes to theme settings to detect unauthorized modifications.
3. **Backup and Version Control**: Maintain backups and version history of theme settings to enable rollback if malicious code is detected.
4. **Content Security Policy**: Consider implementing a strict CSP, but be aware that it may conflict with user-provided scripts. If CSP is implemented, users must ensure their custom scripts comply with the policy.

#### Design Rationale

These settings are intentionally unsanitized to provide maximum flexibility for advanced users who need to:
- Integrate third-party analytics and tracking services
- Add custom styling that cannot be achieved through standard theme settings
- Implement custom functionality through JavaScript
- Integrate with external services and APIs

The security model assumes that:
- Users have full control over their projects and are responsible for the content they add
- The application is primarily used in a single-user or trusted multi-user environment
- Users understand the security implications of injecting raw HTML/CSS/JavaScript

This is similar to how content management systems like WordPress allow administrators to add custom CSS and JavaScript through theme customization panels, with the understanding that administrators are trusted users.

#### Best Practices

1. **Validate Input on Save**: While not sanitizing content, validate that the input is valid text and handle encoding issues appropriately.
2. **Error Handling**: The tag implementations include error handling to prevent template rendering failures if settings are malformed.
3. **Empty Value Handling**: Tags return empty strings when settings are not configured, preventing unnecessary empty tags in the output.
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation in `docs/theming.md` and `docs/core-security.md` helps users understand the risks and proper usage.

#### Future Considerations

If the application evolves to support untrusted multi-user environments or public-facing theme marketplaces, consider:
- Implementing optional sanitization modes (strict vs. permissive)
- Adding CSP headers with nonce or hash-based validation
- Providing a whitelist of allowed script sources
- Implementing code review workflows for theme settings changes
- Adding audit logging for all theme setting modifications

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables (`.env`)

Sensitive configuration and environment-specific settings are stored in a `.env` file, which is kept out of version control. Key variables include:

- `NODE_ENV`: Controls whether the application runs in `development` or `production` mode.
- `PRODUCTION_URL`: The whitelisted domain for CORS in production.
- `VITE_API_URL`: The URL for the backend API, used by the frontend.
- `PORT`: The port number for the server (defaults to 3001).

### Health Check Endpoint

- **What it is:** A simple endpoint (`/health`) that returns the server status and current timestamp.
- **Purpose:** Used for monitoring and load balancer health checks in production environments.
- **Response:** `{ "status": "ok", "timestamp": "..." }`

## ⚙️ Deployment Security

### Production Build

- **Frontend**: The `npm run build` command creates an optimized, minified production build of the React application in the `dist` folder.
- **Backend**: The Express server is configured to serve these static assets efficiently in production mode.

### Static File Serving

- **Configuration**: In production (`NODE_ENV=production`), the server uses `express.static` to serve files from the `dist` directory.
- **Fallback**: A catch-all route (`*`) ensures that React Router handles client-side routing correctly by serving `index.html` for unknown routes.
- **Trust Proxy**: The `trust proxy` setting is enabled in production to ensure rate limiting works correctly behind reverse proxies (like Nginx or Heroku).

### 8. Project Import/Export Security

- **What it is:** Users can export projects as ZIP files containing all project source files and metadata, and import them into different installations.
- **Why it's important:** Import functionality accepts ZIP files from external sources, which introduces security risks if not properly validated and isolated.

#### Security Risks

**1. File Upload Validation**
- Malicious ZIP files could contain:
  - Path traversal attacks (`../` sequences) to write files outside the project directory
  - Extremely large files causing disk space exhaustion
  - Malformed ZIP structures causing denial of service
  - Executable files that could be executed if extracted incorrectly

**2. Content Validation**
- Imported projects may contain:
  - Malicious Liquid template code in widget files
  - Malicious JavaScript in custom theme settings
  - Corrupted JSON files causing application errors
  - Invalid file names with special characters

**3. Resource Exhaustion**
- Large ZIP files or many files could:
  - Exhaust available disk space
  - Cause memory issues during extraction
  - Take excessive time to process, blocking other requests

#### Mitigation Strategies

**1. File Upload Validation**
- **MIME Type Validation**: Validate ZIP file type using both MIME type (`application/zip`, `application/x-zip-compressed`) and file extension (`.zip`)
- **File Size Limits**: Enforce maximum ZIP file size (500MB) using multer limits
- **Path Traversal Protection**: 
  - Extract to temporary directory first
  - Validate all file paths before copying to project directory
  - Use `path.resolve()` and check that resolved paths stay within allowed directories
  - Reject any paths containing `..` sequences or absolute paths
- **File Name Sanitization**: 
  - Validate file names to prevent special characters that could cause issues
  - Reject file names with null bytes, control characters, or reserved names

**2. Import Isolation**
- **Temporary Extraction**: Extract ZIP to isolated temporary directory first
- **Validation Before Copy**: Validate all files and structure before copying to project directory
- **FolderName Sanitization**: Generate new folderName from project name using `slugify()` to prevent directory traversal
- **New UUID Generation**: Always generate new project UUID on import to prevent ID conflicts and ensure isolation

**3. Content Validation**
- **Manifest Validation**: Require and validate `project-export.json` manifest file
- **JSON Structure Validation**: Validate JSON structure of all JSON files during import
- **Theme Verification**: Verify that the project's theme exists in the target installation before import
- **File Type Validation**: Only allow expected file types (JSON, Liquid, CSS, JS, images, videos, audio)

**4. Resource Limits**
- **ZIP Size Limits**: Maximum 500MB per ZIP file
- **File Count Limits**: Consider limiting the number of files in a ZIP (currently unlimited, but monitored)
- **Timeout Protection**: Set reasonable timeouts for import operations
- **Disk Space Checks**: Verify sufficient disk space before starting import

**5. Error Handling**
- **Cleanup on Failure**: Always clean up temporary files and partial project directories on import failure
- **Graceful Degradation**: Return clear error messages without exposing internal paths or system details
- **Transaction-like Behavior**: Import should be atomic - either fully succeeds or fully fails with cleanup

#### Implementation Details

**Backend (`server/controllers/projectController.js`):**
- Uses `multer` with memory storage and 500MB file size limit
- Validates ZIP structure and manifest before extraction
- Extracts to temporary directory (`data/temp/import-{timestamp}/`)
- Validates all file paths using `path.resolve()` and directory checks
- Generates new UUID and folderName for imported project
- Cleans up temporary files on both success and failure

**Frontend (`src/components/projects/ProjectImportModal.jsx`):**
- Validates file type before upload (ZIP extension and MIME type)
- Shows clear error messages for validation failures
- Provides upload progress feedback

#### Best Practices for Users

1. **Source Verification**: Only import projects from trusted sources
2. **Backup Before Import**: Maintain backups before importing projects
3. **Review Imported Content**: Review imported project files, especially custom widgets and theme settings
4. **Theme Compatibility**: Ensure required themes are installed before importing projects

#### Future Considerations

If the application evolves to support public project sharing or marketplaces:
- Implement digital signatures for verified project exports
- Add project export format versioning with migration paths
- Implement content scanning for known malicious patterns
- Add project reputation/rating system
- Implement sandboxed import environment for untrusted sources
